After I graduated from UBC with my second degree, a BSc in Computer Science, I was lost for a little while. I had done quite well on coursework but had never really focused on employment skills. "Things will fall into place," I figured.

That didn't happen though. For a couple of months I tried finding a job with no experience - I had foregone the co-op program because I wanted to be out of school ASAP. I did get close with one well-pedigreed cybersecurity company, but was not hired, I think, due to lack of interviewing experience. I did very well on the written exam and most of the face-to-face interview, but could have answered some key questions much more strongly. But it gave me hope. _I got that far by meeting one of the managers at the company's hiring fair - in-person introductions are much stronger than putting your resume through online filtering systems. I was even lucky enough to receive another chance, to interview with a different team, after not being hired for this team!_

Shortly after that, a family member came across a posting for free (a.k.a. government-funded) employment training for IT professionals, with resume/cover letter guidance, interview practice, job market information, and free Scrum certification included to boot. So I went in for an info session, interviewed, and was accepted into the [program](https://www.successbc.ca/eng/services/employment-services/4364-project-based-training-pbt-information-communication-and-technology). Our group was around 10 people of varying experience, all friendly, supportive, and going through a similar job search experience - a little family. They were the best part about this program.

Using what I learned, I applied for jobs, interviewed with several companies and, shortly after the in-class training ended, during the coaching/job-search second half of the program, I received and finalized an offer for my first job! My coach was a wonderful lady working in HR at the same cybersecurity company I had interviewed at twice just a couple of months earlier. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Anyways, her advice was invaluable, and having something there to bounce ideas off of, to learn tips and tricks, and provide some emotional support in such an uncertain situation was really great. 

After the program ended for me, the charity received more funding and another intake of job seekers was trained. I was asked if I'd like to volunteer as a coach. I didn't hesitate; I felt that I had gained so much from the program that I just _had_ to pay it forward. Over the past year and a half, I have been a coach in this program to four people. Two days before writing this post, my latest coachee received a job offer from a cool local company and I couldn't be happier for him ðŸ˜ƒ Likewise for my previous coachees, especially the new grads who I have the most similar experience to.

What has this volunteering meant for me?

- Good vibes

- Meeting people I would otherwise never meet

- Reflect on my own job search and employment experience

- More experience with personal branding for my future benefit

- Experience evaluating resumes/cover letters, and interview Q and As

- Some networking

- Confidence 

I highly recommend finding mentoring opportunities like this. They _will_ help you in your own career because of the chance to introspect, and you will also feel great about providing guidance and reassurance to someone who's shoes you were in not long ago.

P.S. Everyone from my intake found a position in their field - way to go!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
