Hello World!

This blog is built using the following stack:

- Linode - affordable VPS that satisfies my needs. ðŸ’° 
- Nginx - for content delivery.
- Docker - for easy minimal-config Nginx deployment ðŸ˜ƒ, and to keep source/generated output separate from the delivery mechanism, since that could change. Probably not though. It's still nice to keep things modular though! 
- Hugo - a Go-based static site generator with Markdown and templating.
- hugo-bingo - a beautifully minimal Hugo theme.
